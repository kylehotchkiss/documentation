# Salt Cell Acid Washing

I have a saltwater pool. Due to the water quality and high evaporation rates at my location, the calcium in my pool water collects very quickly. This causes the Salt Cell to clog up and need an acid wash. Acid washing is intrinsicly destructive to Salt Cells so it's important to conduct regular washes at the minimum time needed to remove the buildup from the cell blades.

I generally can tell when my salt cell needs a wash by a singnicantly lower level of chlorine in my pool and the salt cell will report very low salinity. The calcium build up reduces the conductivity the salinity sensor can detect.

## Instructions

* Turn pool off, unplug salt cell from power
* Remove the pool cell from the plumbing connections
* Place a cap on the short end of the cell
* Make a mixture of 1 quart murietic (hydrocloric) acid with 1 gallon of water. Always pour acid into water, and never water into acid.
* Pour enough of the diluted acid into the capped salt cell. Only cover the blades, do not fill past them
* The solution will bubble vigorously for several minutes. Once the bubbling has stopped, pour the salt cell contents back into the bucket of diluted acid
* Rinse the salt cell out
* Connect back to the plumbing and plugin in
* Run a quick clean cycle. WARNING: You've just filled your plumbing with air, so remember to not stand right next to your pool equipment as it re-pressurizes
* Once your pump has primed, return to the salt cell and analyze:
  * Are there any leaks?
  * Is the salinity indicator green now?
  * When you enter diagnostics mode, does the salinity number seem higher?
* Pour the contents of the diluted acid into the pool, taking care to distribute it. Since your salt cell is now going to run much more effectively, your PH is going to climb relatively more quickly in the coming days
* After one day, check again
  * Is my pools chlorine improving? 
* After three days, check again
  * Is my pools chlorine too high? Adjust output. For my 15,000 gallon pool with a freshly washed acid cell, and left reguarly covered, 30 is the right output level for me. 

## Protips

* Don't try to shock your pool by setting the output to 100. Yes, it works, but it also causes your salt cell to clog up extremely quickly and spikes your PH very quickly.
